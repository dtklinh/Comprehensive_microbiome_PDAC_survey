## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Lab Contamination Survey

To address the issue of contamination, we comprehensively collected a large number of negative control samples (NCT) at each stage of the wet-lab sample processing workflow (*Fig. xxx*), including **93** paraffin controls, **133** buffer controls, **11** PCR controls, and **3** sequencing controls, resulting in a total of **6128** taxa. We remove sequencing control samples due to insufficient reads (≤ 750) as well as taxa with extremely low prevalence and abundance. With that criteria, we further filter out and result in **203** negative control samples, comprising **113** buffer controls, **84** paraffin controls, and **6** PCR control. That results in **1775** taxa after rarefaction as normalization. These negative controls were accumulated over several years, with a significant expansion in control type paraffin and buffer introduced in 2022 (Table 1 ).

<!--To reduce potential noise, we filtered out samples with fewer than 750 reads. Taxa with extremely low prevalence and abundance were also removed (Methods section), resulting in a final dataset of 203 negative control samples with 1775 taxa.-->
