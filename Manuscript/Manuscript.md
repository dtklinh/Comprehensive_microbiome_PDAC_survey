### Lab Contamination Survey

To address the issue of contamination, we comprehensively collected a large number of negative control samples (NCT) at each stage of the wet-lab sample processing workflow (Fig. xxx), including **93** paraffin controls, **133** buffer controls, **11** PCR controls, and **3** sequencing controls, resulting in a total of 6128 taxa. We remove sequencing control samples due to insufficient reads (≤ 750) as well as taxa with extremely low prevalence and abundance. With that criteria, we further filter out and result in **203** negative control samples, comprising **113** buffer controls, **84** paraffin controls, and **6** PCR control. That results in **1775** taxa after rarefaction as normalization. These negative controls were accumulated over several years, with a significant expansion in control type paraffin and buffer introduced in 2022 (Table 1 ).
