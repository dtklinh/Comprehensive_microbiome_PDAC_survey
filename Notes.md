# Note

1)  Normalization:

-   Wrench normalization (WN): decontam approaches should not be the condition for WN, instead using other medical caterories such as sex, treatment, condition, which will also be used for the differential analysis.
-   WN w.r.t TA or mouse gender.
-   Alternatively, applying ANCOM_BC
